## 01: A Game of Chicken

- `Poule` in French means chicken.
- `jeu de poule` in French means the person who won "The game of chicken".

## 02: Hydrogentlemanly
- The word `gene` comes from Greek word `genos` which means birth.
- Same root is found in generation, regeneration and degenration.
- It's latin cousin `genus` is widely spread in English. ex: generous which originally meant "well-born". It was obvious that well-bred people were magnanimous and peasants were stingy, it came to mean munificent.
- The word `gentle` in gentleman came to known as being "soft" after all being "well-bred"/"well-born".
- The word `gin` in gingerly is probably just another `gen` lurking around. Gingerly (:in a careful or cautious manner.) has nothing to do with ginger
- Oxygen was called flammable air for a while, but it didn’t catch on.
- A Frenchman named Lavoisier decided that the sort of air that produced water when it was burnt should be called the `water-producer`. Greek for water producer is `hydro-gen`.
- The bit of air that made things acidic he decided to call the `acid-maker` or `oxy-gen`
- Argon, the other major gas in air, wasn’t known about at the time, because it’s an inert gas and doesn’t produce anything at all. That’s why it’s called argon. Argon is Greek for `lazy`.
- A group of things that reproduce is a `genus` and if you’re talking about a whole `genus` then you’re speaking in `general` and if you’re in `general` command of the troops you’re a `general` and a `general` can order his troops to commit `genocide`, which, etymologically, would be suicide. Now a general won’t commit genocide himself; he’ll probably assign the job to his privates, and privates is a euphemism for gonads, which comes from exactly the same root.
