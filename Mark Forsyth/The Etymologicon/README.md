## 02: Hydrogentlemanly
- The word `gene` comes from Greek word `genos` which means birth.
- Same root is found in generation, regeneration and degenration.
- It's latin cousin `genus` is widely spread in English. ex: generous which originally meant "well-born". It was obvious that well-bred people were magnanimous and peasants were stingy, it came to mean munificent.
- The word `gentle` in gentleman came to known as being "soft" after all being "well-bred"/"well-born".
- The word `gin` in gingerly is probably just another `gen` lurking around. Gingerly has nothing to do with ginger
- Oxygen was called flammable air for a while, but it didn’t catch on.
- A Frenchman named Lavoisier decided that the sort of air that produced water when it was burnt should be called the `water-producer`. Greek for water producer is `hydro-gen`.
- Meaning of 'oxy' in Greek is acidic or sour. The bit of air that made things acidic he decided to call the `acid-maker` or `oxy-gen`
- Argon, the other major gas in air, wasn’t known about at the time, because it’s an inert gas and doesn’t produce anything at all. That’s why it’s called argon. Argon is Greek for `lazy`.
- A group of things that reproduce is a `genus` and if you’re talking about a whole `genus` then you’re speaking in `general` and if you’re in `general` command of the troops you’re a `general` and a `general` can order his troops to commit `genocide`, which, etymologically, would be suicide. Now a general won’t commit genocide himself; he’ll probably assign the job to his privates, and privates is a euphemism for gonads, which comes from exactly the same root.

- The Testaments of the Bible testify to God’s truth

- Avocado - Aztech's balls. The Aztecs were a Mesoamerican civilization that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521. The Aztec people included different ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language. The Nahuatl word `ahuacatl` means "avocado". When the Spanish arrived they misheard this slightly and called it aguacate, and the English changed this slightly to avocado.
- `Orchis` in Greek also means testicle and is borrowed from Latin. The technical term for somebody who has a lot of balls is a polyorchid.
