- A Frenchman named Lavoisier decided that the sort of air that produced water when it was burnt should be called the `water-producer`. Greek for water producer is `hydro-gen`.
- Meaning of 'oxy' in Greek is acidic or sour. The bit of air that made things acidic he decided to call the `acid-maker` or `oxy-gen`

- The execution went verty badly. They tried a number of things and finally they chopped his head off long after he forgave his executioner and became a megalomartyrs.
- This last kindness was what earned the doctor the name `Pantaleon`, which means _All-Compassionate_.
- By the tenth century Saint Pantaleon had become the patron saint of Venice. `Pantalon` therefore became a popular Venetian name and the Venetians themselves were often called the `Pantaloni`.
- Then, in the sixteenth century, came the _Commedia Dell’Arte_: short comic plays in which Pantalone was the stereotypical Venetian. He was a merchant and a miser and a lustful old man, and he wore one-piece breeches, like Venetians did.
- These long breeches therefore became known as **_pantaloons_**.
- Pantaloons were shortened to pants and the English (though not the Americans) called their underwear underpants.
- So pants and panties come from Saint Pantaleon and your undies are all-compassionate and your small-clothes are martyred.
