## 01: Alliteration
- `thou hadst small Latin and less Greek` - Ben Jonson (Shakespeare's friend)

- The moment Antony saw Cleopatra on the barge and fell in love with
  her:

  The barge she sat in like a burnished throne,\
  Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\
  Purple the sails and so perfumed that\
  The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,\
  Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made \
  The water which they beat to follow faster,\
  As amorous of their strokes.

- Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol.\
  **"Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail."**\
  _Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to   regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail._
- John Keats wote 14 lines of F's

    Deep in the shady sadness of a vale\
    Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\
    Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\
    Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\
    Still as the silence round about his lair;\
    Forest on forest hung about his head\
    Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\
    Not so much life as on a summer’s day\
    Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,\
    But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\
    A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\
    By reason of his fallen divinity\
    Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds\
    Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.

## 02: Polyptoton
- Please Please Me’ is a classic case of polyptoton.
- The first please is please the interjection, as in ‘Please mind the gap’. The second please is a verb meaning to give pleasure, as in ‘This pleases me’. Same word: two different parts of speech.
- Shakespeare was so fond of polyptoton that he just repeated himself wholesale. He had a trick and he liked it and he used it again and again. So in Richard II Bolingbroke, busy revolting, says ‘My gracious uncle’, but his uncle, the Duke of York replies:\
  Tut, tut!\
  Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\
  I am no traitor’s uncle; and that word ‘grace’\
  In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
- Anybody can write ‘Hello me no hellos’. It is a trick available to everyone
  and the best example was by a lady called Susanna Centlivre from "The Busybody" where a son is arguing with his father about the usual father–son issues of money, marriage, and remarriage. The father says:\
  Sir Francis: Out of my Doors, you Dog; you pretend to meddle with my Marriage, Sirrah.\
  Charles: Sir, I obey: But—\
  Sir Francis: But me no Buts— Be gone, Sir: Dare to ask me for Money agen— Refuse Forty Thousand Pound! Out of my Doors, I say, without Reply.
- These are the most obvious forms of polyptoton: but verb versus but viewed as a word itself. It’s almost too easy to do, but you’re bound to come up with a good line, so "never say never".
- Much more subtle are Shakespeare’s ‘Speak the speech’ or ‘The rain it raineth every day’, both of which could be shortened to ‘Speak’ or ‘It
  raineth’, but they wouldn’t sound as good.
- The son of God tended to use subtler polyptotons. ‘Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us’ is a pretty neat double.
- Polyptoton is a favourite of Jesus, Shakespeare and John Lennon. With a trio like that one can almost forget the smaller voices: Moses’ wife saying ‘I have been a stranger in a strange land’, or William Blake’s ‘Piper, pipe that song again’.
- Polyptoton, even though nobody has ever heard of it, succeeds, and nothing succeeds like success. Its like you talk the talk and walk the walk.

### Vocabulary:
1. **jaunt**: a short excursion or journey made for pleasure.

## 03: Antithesis
22-Dec-2024

- Antitheses are simple: first you mention one thing: then you mention another.
- Oscar Wilde was the master of these, with lines like, ‘The well-bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.’
- Wildean antitheses are not too hard. You make a first statement that is relatively obvious, for example, 
  - ‘If a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough.’ The second half begins in an obvious way: ‘If he is not a gentleman’ ... and then takes an odd turn: ‘whatever he knows is bad for him.’
  - ‘Wicked women bother one’ looks as though it will be followed by ‘Good women console one’, but instead it is followed by ‘Good women bore one.’ **OR**
  - Women represent the triumph of matter over mind; men represent the triumph of’ ... and again the reader expects mind over matter, but instead gets ‘mind over morals’. **OR** 
  - ‘Journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read’ **OR**
  - ‘If one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.’ **OR**
  - Some men invent epigrams – and then you add unexpected inversion – others are invented by them.
- But these are all just plays on the basic formula of antithesis: X is Y, and not X is not Y.
- ‘Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.’
- Any statement, however basic, can grow into an antithesis. Why just say 'life is sweet' when you can add that 'death is sour'?
- Why point out that the sun rises in the morning without mentioning that it sets in the evening? Of course, anyone could have worked the second halves out for themselves, but what does that matter? United we stand, divided we fall, even though both statements imply the other.
- If you said that "Those who can’t write themselves instruct other people on how to write", who would remember? But say ‘Those who can, do: those who can’t, teach’ then it becomes a memorable line.
- Charles Dickens in "The tale of two cities"\
  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\
  it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,\
  it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, \
  it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,\
  it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,\
  we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, \
  we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way ...
- T.S Eliot wrote: 'Immature poets imitate. Mature poets steal.'
- The great subject of antithesis seems to be marriage. ‘Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures’ (Samuel Johnson)
- 'Kissing don't last, cookery do' (George Meredith)

### Vocabulary:
1. **epigram**: a pithy saying or remark expressing an idea in a clever and amusing way.
2. **chock-a-block**: crammed full of people or things.

## 04: Merism

- Merism is when you don’t say what you’re talking about, and instead name all of its parts. Ladies and gentlemen, for example, is a merism for people, because all people are either ladies or gentlemen. 
- The beauty of merism is that it’s absolutely unnecessary.
- In the medieval marriage service ‘sickness and health’ were followed by: ‘to be bonny and buxom, in bed and at board, till death do us part.’ How could a wife guarantee that she would be buxom?
- The word buxom has changed in meaning over the years. The first citation in the Oxford English Dictionary comes from the twelfth century and is defined as: ‘Obedient; pliant; compliant, tractable.’ The sense then changed to happy, then to healthy, and thence to plump.
- While the word "bonny" comes from the French `bon` and the Latin `bonus`, both of which mean good. So a bonny and buxom wife was a good and obedient one.
- Tennyson wrote up one of the most memorable in The Charge of the Light Brigade where the six hundred have:\
  _Cannon to right of them,\
  Cannon to left of them,\
  Cannon in front of them\
  Volleyed and thundered;\
  Stormed at with shot and shell,\
  Boldly they rode and well,\
  Into the jaws of Death,\
  Into the mouth of hell\
  Rode the six hundred._
- the word quaquaversally meaning in every direction. ‘Cannon quaquaversally’ would have saved time, but wouldn’t have been nearly as poetic
- Natural home of merism is in legal documents. A lawyer, for a reason or reasons known only to him or herself, cannot see a whole without dividing it into its parts and enumerating them in immense detail. The lawyer’s lucky phrase is ‘including but not limited to’, which gets you out of the utterly unnecessary trouble that the utterly unnecessary merism got you into in the first place. Merism searches for wholes, and leaves holes

### Vocabulary:
1. **derided**: express contempt for; ridicule.

## 05: The Blazon (Merrism went too far)

- When poets fall in love, they make a list of their loved one’s body parts and attach similes to them. Your lips are like cherries, your hair is like gold, and your eyes are like traffic lights that make my heart stop and go.
- The final and finest blazon is an epitaph for a drowned man:\
  Full fathom five thy father lies;\
  Of his bones are coral made;\
  Those are pearls that were his eyes;\
  Nothing of him that doth fade,\
  But doth suffer a sea-change\
  Into something rich and strange.
- The idea that an oyster has eaten and then excreted your eyeballs is about as romantic as the blazon gets, yet it continues.
- But her smile is like a breath of spring, which is an example of synaesthesia.

## 06: Synaesthesia

- Synaesthesia is either a mental condition whereby colours are perceived as smells, smells as sounds, sounds as tastes etc., or it is a rhetorical device whereby one sense is described in terms of another. If colours are harmonious or a voice is silky, that is synaesthesia
- Sight and sound are interchangeable. ‘Orange’, colours can be loud or discordant while melodies can be bright and rumblings dark.
- Tone is even an ambiguous word that can be applied to either sense.
- Blues music is no more blue than blue movies are.
- Touch can be applied to sound – a gravelly voice – and to sight – the warm colours of a painting.
- Taste gives you a couple of terms of approbation – delicious and tasty – and of deprecation – bland or disgusting.
- Smell sits apart on his own. 
- She smelled the way the Taj Mahal looks by moonlight. _The Little Sister_ by Raymond Chandler
- Synaesthesias of smell are jarring and effective, and are probably an easy shortcut to a memorable line.
- However, caution should be observed.Many critics have been wrong, some amazingly so, but few will be remembered as Eduard Hanslick is; he wrote of Tchaikovsky’s First Violin Concerto which showed there could be ‘music that stinks to the ear’.
- Synaesthesia reaches its purest form when a sense is given to something completely abstract. Victory does not look like anything visible or sound like anything audible or taste like anything edible, but it has a smell, a smell memorably described in _Apocalypse Now_
  I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. [...] The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like ... victory. Someday this war’s gonna end ...

### Idioms, Proverbs & Phrases:
1. pull you up short: is an idiom which means "to suddenly stop what one is doing." Ex:
   - I had to slam on the brakes when the car in front of me pulled up short.
   - He began to answer her question and then pulled up short.
   - And that is why the Raymond Chandler line is so striking. Though the sense is quite discernible, the expression of it pulls you up short.


### Vocabulary:
1. **discordant**: disagreeing or incongruous
2. **approbation**: approval or praise.
3. **emissaries**: a person sent as a diplomatic representative on a special mission.
4. **odious**: extremely unpleasant; repulsive.
5. **discernible**: perceptible

## 07: Aposiopesis

- Aposiopesis is ...(English punctuation by three dots)
- There were two important trees in the Garden of Eden: the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. We chose knowledge. Once the game was up, He cursed Adam, Eve and the talking snake, and then He said:\
  _And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat,\
  and live for ever ... Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of\
  Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken_.
- God did not finish His sentence. But the point of aposiopesis is that you don’t need to go on\
  _**When in Rome... (do as the romans do)\
  Speak of the devil...(and doth he appears)\
  United we stand...(divided we fall)\
  Out of the mouth of babes... (and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger)**_
- Sometimes, though, aposiopesis is because you simply don’t know what to say. This can leave you looking rather foolish, like a parent trying to get children to do something but not being able to think, o and, of an appropriate threat. Thus poor King Lear with his naughty daughters:\
  **_No, you unnatural hags,\
  I will have such revenges on you both,\
  That all the world shall ... I will do such things ...\
  What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be\
  The terrors of the earth._**\
  which is much verbose version of saying  _‘Tidy your room, or else ...’_


### Idioms, Proverbs & Phrases:
1. **out of the mouths of babes (and sucklings)**: an idiom is used to describe when a child says something that is wise or surprising. For example, “She's only six but she said, quite rightly, that Harry was afraid of the sitter—out of the mouths of babes, Mother said”

### Vocabulary:
1. **whodunit**: a story or play about a murder in which the identity of the murderer is not revealed until the end.

## 08: Hyperbaton

- Hyperbaton is when you put words in an odd order, which is very, very diﬃcult to do in English.
- Given that almost everything else in the English language is slapdash, happy-go-lucky, care-may-the- Devil, word order is surprisingly strict.
- John Ronald Reuel Tolkien wrote his first story aged seven about a **‘green great dragon’**. He was corrected by his mother that he couldn’t have a **green great dragon**, and that it had to be a **"great green one"** instead. Tolkien was so disheartened that he never wrote another story for years.
- Adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest it will be deemed incorrect.
- Since size comes before colour, green great dragons can’t exist.
- When you repeat a word with a diﬀerent vowel, the order is always I A O. So you have Bish Bash Bosh. Politicians may _flip-flop_, but they can never flop-flip.It’s _tit-for-tat_, never tat-for-tit. This is called **_ablaut reduplication_**, and if you do things any other way, they sound very odd indeed. Similar examples exist like: _ding-dong_ (not dong ding) and _hip-hop_ (not hop-hip)
- The importance of English word order is also the reason that the idea that you can’t end a sentence with a preposition (which is utter hogwash). The rule is often unfairly blamed on a chap called Robert Lowth who wrote a book called A Short Introduction to English Grammar (1762) which says: \
  _PREPOSITIONS have Government of Cases; and in English they always require the Objective Case after them: as, ‘with him; from her, to me.’ The Preposition is often separated from the Relative which it governs and joined to the Verb at the end of the Sentence, or of some member of it. Ex: ‘Horace is an author, whom I am much delighted with.’This is an Idiom which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar style in writing; but the placing of the Preposition before the Relative is more graceful as well as more perspicuous; and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style_
- Any phrasal verb in the imperative has to end with a preposition. Otherwise, you’d shout ‘Out look! Down get! On we are being fired!’ Referees would say ‘On play’. Oﬀ would take planes. And nobody would be allowed to _sleep in_.
- Hyperbaton is a slap in the face to any English speaker. n 1642 a chap called Richard Lovelace was stuck in prison, pining for his girlfriend. He wrote her a poem about how he wasn’t really in prison, and proved it with metaphor. The last verse began:\
 _**Stone walls do not a prison make,\
  Nor iron bars a cage …**_\
  Which is a hyperbaton because "make" should come between not and a. Now it is quoted so much that it has become part of the language. And not just that exact line, any variant can be used: _adjective noun does not a noun make._
- _Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown_ is one hell of a lot more memorable than The head that wears the crown lies uneasily.

### Vocabulary:
1. **hogwash**: nonsense
2. **slapdash**: done too hurriedly and carelessly. (ex: he gave a slapdash performance)
3. **perspicuous**: clearly expressed and easily understood; lucid.

## 09: Anadiplosis

- In Star wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, Yoda announces "fear leads to anger, anger leads to hatred, hatred leads to suffering". This is called anadiplosis.
- A previous spiritual teacher: St Paul quoted:\
  _**We glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience,\
  and patience, experience, and experience, hope, and hope maketh man not\
  ashamed**_.
- A semi-fictional American character called Jesse Jackson who observed that:\
  _**Suffering breeds character; character breeds faith; in the end faith will not
  disappoint**_.
- There’s a logical fallacy called the quaternio terminorum, or fallacy of the four terms, that goes something like this:\
  _**A ham sandwich is better than nothing. \
  Nothing is better than eternal happiness. \
  So eternal happiness is beaten by a ham sandwich**_.
- The trick there is that the specific meaning of nothing has been changed from ‘lack of food’ to ‘impossibility’.
- Of course, anadiplosis doesn’t have to be used for logic. It can simply add a harmony, in the same way that a repeated musical phrase binds two sections together.
- Maximus Decimus Meridius Russell Crow in the film Gladiator:\
  _**The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story**_.
- If you say it like this: _The general who became a slave who became a gladiator who defied an emperor_ would sound like a rather incoherent nursery rhyme.
- However, this is an example of periodic sentence:
  _If the soup had been as warm as the wine, and the wine as old as the fish,\
  and the fish as young as the maid, and the maid as willing as the hostess, it\
  would have been a very good meal._

### Vocabulary:
1. **gravitas**: seriousness and importance of manner

## 10: Periodic Sentences

- The little dot at the end of a sentence is either called a full stop or, if you’re of the American persuasion, a period
- The period is one of the most complicated and convoluted concepts of classical rhetoric. Nobody in the ancient world could quite decide what it meant, but they were united in the belief that it was terribly important.
- The essence of a periodic sentence is that, until you’ve got to the end, until you’ve found that clause or verb that completes the syntax, until you’ve finally got to the period, you can’t stop.
- As long as you dont blurt out your main verb too early or as you begin clause after clause with when or if or though or while or as long as you can keep going through fourteen apposite clauses and as long as you dont mind being a tad artificial, periodic sentences are a doddle
- In the song 'Every Breath You Take' Sting maintained the self-control to save his main verb for
  the end of the verse:\
  _**Every breath you take,\
  Every move you make,\
  Every bond you break,\
  Every step you take,\
  I’ll be watching you.**_

## 11: Hypotaxis and Parataxis

- Parataxis is good, plain English. It’s one sentence after another. It’s direct. ex:\
  You don’t want.\
  to buy my cattle. They’re good cattle. You don’t know cattle.\ 
  I’m going to have a drink. Then I’m going to break your jaw.\
  I’m a paratactic farmer. My cattle are the best in England.
- Parataxis is the natural way of speaking English. 
- English is a basically uninflected language. Everything depends on the word order. It’s all subject-verb-object. ex: The man kicked the dog. The cat sat on the mat.
- In Latin and German and in many different languages words can be moved around and you still understand the sentence because of the endings. ex:\
  _**Nauta amat puellam**_ and _**Puellam nauta amat**_ both mean ‘The sailor loves the girl’.
- That doesn't happen in English. Its paratactic. They don’t have to be sentences, they could be divided by commas, they could be divided by semi-colons; But you can get round the punctuation problem by using conjunctions and just keep your sentence going and going forever.
- Using lots of conjunctions is called `polysyndeton`. No conjunctions is called `asyndeton`. ex:\
  _And Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to his disciples
  saying ‘Take, eat, this is my body_
- There’s nothing wrong with parataxis. It’s good, simple, clean, plain-living, English. Wham. Bam. Thank you, ma’am.
- Alternatively, should you choose to employ use of subordinate clause upon subordinate clause, which itself may be subordinated to those clauses that have gone before or after, to construct a sentence of such labyrinthine grammatical complexity that you unravel a ball of grammatical yarn which leaves the audience in amaze trying to look for a fullstop. - That’s hypotaxis.
- Thomas Browne gave to the English language the glory of the preposterously long sentence: sentences that nobody in their right minds would ever say aloud, sentences that are intricate games, filled with fine flourishes and curious convolutions. Such sentences have a remarkable quality: civilisation.
- Hypotaxis is unnatural in English; If someone was furious about a sycophantic lawyer they might say:
  ‘Lawyers are only interested in money. Sure, lawyers pay you compliments. Compliments are free.’ But when Charles Dickens said exactly the same thing, he phrased it like this:\
  _**It was a maxim with Mr Brass that the habit of paying compliments kept a\
  man’s tongue oiled without any expense; and that, as that useful member\
  ought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case of a\
  practitioner of the law, in whom it should be always glib and easy, he lost\
  few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance of handsome\
  speeches and eulogistic expressions.**_ 
- Seventy-three words of hypotactic fun that somehow never seems rude, even though it definitely is
- You can’t gush with hypotaxis. If I told you: ‘She’s beautiful and clever and rich. She’s got a lovely house. She’s always friendly. She has all the best things that a person can have. She’s 21. Nothing bad ever happens to her’, you’d think that I was afflicted with the most tedious variety of love. But Jane Austen wrote exactly the same thing as the first line of Emma:\
  _**Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\
  and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\
  existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\
  little to distress or vex her.**_
- You can almost see Miss Austen winking at you over a cup of tea.
- Absolutely anything sounds civilised and well-thought-out, provided that it’s expressed in the most syntactically complicated, hyper-hypotactic manner.
- Even pornography had an air of considered calm to it, now lost for ever to the discerning pervert. Fanny Hill (1748) is generally thought the greatest mucky novel in English literature. but when such coarsely eternal activities are laced into a mad grammarian’s fantasy, the result is superb:\
  _**Coming then into my chamber, and seeing me lie alone, with my face turned\
  from the light towards the inside of the bed, he, without more ado, just\
  slipped off his breeches, for the greater ease and enjoyment of the naked\
  touch; and softly turning up my petticoats and shift behind, opened the\
  prospect of the back avenue to the genial seat of pleasure; where, as I lay at\
  my side length, inclining rather face downward, I appeared full fair, and\
  liable to be entered. Laying himself gently down by me, he invested me\
  behind, and giving me to feel the warmth of his body, as he applied his\
  thighs and belly close to me, and the endeavours of that machine, whose\
  touch has something so exquisitely singular in it, to make its way good into me**_.
- If one attempts to rewrite that in the paratactic style, it loses all its charm will indeed be considered vulgar.
- Hypotaxis was what made English prose so terribly, terribly civilised. It still works.
