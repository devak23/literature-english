## 01: Alliteration
- `thou hadst small Latin and less Greek` - Ben Jonson (Shakespeare's friend)

- The moment Antony saw Cleopatra on the barge and fell in love with
  her:

  The barge she sat in like a burnished throne,\
  Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\
  Purple the sails and so perfumed that\
  The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,\
  Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made \
  The water which they beat to follow faster,\
  As amorous of their strokes.

- Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol.\
  **"Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail."**\
  _Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to   regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail._
- John Keats wote 14 lines of F's

    Deep in the shady sadness of a vale\
    Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\
    Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\
    Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\
    Still as the silence round about his lair;\
    Forest on forest hung about his head\
    Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\
    Not so much life as on a summer’s day\
    Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,\
    But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\
    A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\
    By reason of his fallen divinity\
    Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds\
    Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.

## 02: Polyptoton
- Please Please Me’ is a classic case of polyptoton.
- The first please is please the interjection, as in ‘Please mind the gap’. The second please is a verb meaning to give pleasure, as in ‘This pleases me’. Same word: two different parts of speech.
- Shakespeare was so fond of polyptoton that he just repeated himself wholesale. He had a trick and he liked it and he used it again and again. So in Richard II Bolingbroke, busy revolting, says ‘My gracious uncle’, but his uncle, the Duke of York replies:\
  Tut, tut!\
  Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\
  I am no traitor’s uncle; and that word ‘grace’\
  In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
- Anybody can write ‘Hello me no hellos’. It is a trick available to everyone
  and the best example was by a lady called Susanna Centlivre from "The Busybody" where a son is arguing with his father about the usual father–son issues of money, marriage, and remarriage. The father says:\
  Sir Francis: Out of my Doors, you Dog; you pretend to meddle with my Marriage, Sirrah.\
  Charles: Sir, I obey: But—\
  Sir Francis: But me no Buts— Be gone, Sir: Dare to ask me for Money agen— Refuse Forty Thousand Pound! Out of my Doors, I say, without Reply.
- These are the most obvious forms of polyptoton: but verb versus but viewed as a word itself. It’s almost too easy to do, but you’re bound to come up with a good line, so "never say never".
- Much more subtle are Shakespeare’s ‘Speak the speech’ or ‘The rain it raineth every day’, both of which could be shortened to ‘Speak’ or ‘It
  raineth’, but they wouldn’t sound as good.
- The son of God tended to use subtler polyptotons. ‘Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us’ is a pretty neat double.
- Polyptoton is a favourite of Jesus, Shakespeare and John Lennon. With a trio like that one can almost forget the smaller voices: Moses’ wife saying ‘I have been a stranger in a strange land’, or William Blake’s ‘Piper, pipe that song again’.
- Polyptoton, even though nobody has ever heard of it, succeeds, and nothing succeeds like success. Its like you talk the talk and walk the walk.

### Vocabulary:
**jaunt**: a short excursion or journey made for pleasure.
