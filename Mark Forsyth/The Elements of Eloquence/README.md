## 01: Alliteration
- `thou hadst small Latin and less Greek` - Ben Jonson (Shakespeare's friend)

- The moment Antony saw Cleopatra on the barge and fell in love with
  her:

  The barge she sat in like a burnished throne,\
  Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\
  Purple the sails and so perfumed that\
  The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,\
  Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made \
  The water which they beat to follow faster,\
  As amorous of their strokes.

- Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol.\
  **"Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail."**\
  _Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to   regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail._
- John Keats wote 14 lines of F's

    Deep in the shady sadness of a vale\
    Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\
    Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\
    Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\
    Still as the silence round about his lair;\
    Forest on forest hung about his head\
    Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\
    Not so much life as on a summer’s day\
    Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,\
    But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\
    A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\
    By reason of his fallen divinity\
    Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds\
    Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.

## 02: Polyptoton
- Please Please Me’ is a classic case of polyptoton.
- The first please is please the interjection, as in ‘Please mind the gap’. The second please is a verb meaning to give pleasure, as in ‘This pleases me’. Same word: two different parts of speech.
- Shakespeare was so fond of polyptoton that he just repeated himself wholesale. He had a trick and he liked it and he used it again and again. So in Richard II Bolingbroke, busy revolting, says ‘My gracious uncle’, but his uncle, the Duke of York replies:\
  Tut, tut!\
  Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\
  I am no traitor’s uncle; and that word ‘grace’\
  In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
- Anybody can write ‘Hello me no hellos’. It is a trick available to everyone
  and the best example was by a lady called Susanna Centlivre from "The Busybody" where a son is arguing with his father about the usual father–son issues of money, marriage, and remarriage. The father says:\
  Sir Francis: Out of my Doors, you Dog; you pretend to meddle with my Marriage, Sirrah.\
  Charles: Sir, I obey: But—\
  Sir Francis: But me no Buts— Be gone, Sir: Dare to ask me for Money agen— Refuse Forty Thousand Pound! Out of my Doors, I say, without Reply.
- These are the most obvious forms of polyptoton: but verb versus but viewed as a word itself. It’s almost too easy to do, but you’re bound to come up with a good line, so "never say never".
- Much more subtle are Shakespeare’s ‘Speak the speech’ or ‘The rain it raineth every day’, both of which could be shortened to ‘Speak’ or ‘It
  raineth’, but they wouldn’t sound as good.
- The son of God tended to use subtler polyptotons. ‘Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us’ is a pretty neat double.
- Polyptoton is a favourite of Jesus, Shakespeare and John Lennon. With a trio like that one can almost forget the smaller voices: Moses’ wife saying ‘I have been a stranger in a strange land’, or William Blake’s ‘Piper, pipe that song again’.
- Polyptoton, even though nobody has ever heard of it, succeeds, and nothing succeeds like success. Its like you talk the talk and walk the walk.

### Vocabulary:
**jaunt**: a short excursion or journey made for pleasure.

## 03: Antithesis
22-Dec-2024

- Antitheses are simple: first you mention one thing: then you mention another.
- Oscar Wilde was the master of these, with lines like, ‘The well-bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.’
- Wildean antitheses are not too hard. You make a first statement that is relatively obvious, for example, 
  - ‘If a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough.’ The second half begins in an obvious way: ‘If he is not a gentleman’ ... and then takes an odd turn: ‘whatever he knows is bad for him.’
  - ‘Wicked women bother one’ looks as though it will be followed by ‘Good women console one’, but instead it is followed by ‘Good women bore one.’ **OR**
  - Women represent the triumph of matter over mind; men represent the triumph of’ ... and again the reader expects mind over matter, but instead gets ‘mind over morals’. **OR** 
  - ‘Journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read’ **OR**
  - ‘If one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.’ **OR**
  - Some men invent epigrams – and then you add unexpected inversion – others are invented by them.
- But these are all just plays on the basic formula of antithesis: X is Y, and not X is not Y.
- ‘Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.’
- Any statement, however basic, can grow into an antithesis. Why just say 'life is sweet' when you can add that 'death is sour'?
- Why point out that the sun rises in the morning without mentioning that it sets in the evening? Of course, anyone could have worked the second halves out for themselves, but what does that matter? United we stand, divided we fall, even though both statements imply the other.
- If you said that "Those who can’t write themselves instruct other people on how to write", who would remember? But say ‘Those who can, do: those who can’t, teach’ then it becomes a memorable line.
- Charles Dickens in "The tale of two cities"\
  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\
  it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,\
  it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, \
  it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,\
  it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,\
  we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, \
  we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way ...
- T.S Eliot wrote: 'Immature poets imitate. Mature poets steal.'
- The great subject of antithesis seems to be marriage. ‘Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures’ (Samuel Johnson)
- 'Kissing don't last, cookery do' (George Meredith)

### Vocabulary:
**epigram**: a pithy saying or remark expressing an idea in a clever and amusing way.\
**chock-a-block**: crammed full of people or things.

## 04: Merism

- Merism is when you don’t say what you’re talking about, and instead name all of its parts. Ladies and gentlemen, for example, is a merism for people, because all people are either ladies or gentlemen. 
- The beauty of merism is that it’s absolutely unnecessary.
- In the medieval marriage service ‘sickness and health’ were followed by: ‘to be bonny and buxom, in bed and at board, till death do us part.’ How could a wife guarantee that she would be buxom?
- The word buxom has changed in meaning over the years. The first citation in the Oxford English Dictionary comes from the twelfth century and is defined as: ‘Obedient; pliant; compliant, tractable.’ The sense then changed to happy, then to healthy, and thence to plump.
- While the word "bonny" comes from the French `bon` and the Latin `bonus`, both of which mean good. So a bonny and buxom wife was a good and obedient one.
- Tennyson wrote up one of the most memorable in The Charge of the Light Brigade where the six hundred have:
  Cannon to right of them,\
  Cannon to left of them,\
  Cannon in front of them ...\
- the word quaquaversally meaning in every direction. ‘Cannon quaquaversally’ would have saved time, but wouldn’t have been nearly as poetic
- Natural home of merism is in legal documents. A lawyer, for a reason or reasons known only to him or herself, cannot see a whole without dividing it into its parts and enumerating them in immense detail. The lawyer’s lucky phrase is ‘including but not limited to’, which gets you out of the utterly unnecessary trouble that the utterly unnecessary merism got you into in the first place. Merism searches for wholes, and leaves holes

### Vocabulary:
**derided**: express contempt for; ridicule.
