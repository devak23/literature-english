## 01: Alliteration
- `thou hadst small Latin and less Greek` - Ben Jonson (Shakespeare's friend)

- The moment Antony saw Cleopatra on the barge and fell in love with
  her:

  The barge she sat in like a burnished throne,\
  Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\
  Purple the sails and so perfumed that\
  The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,\
  Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made \
  The water which they beat to follow faster,\
  As amorous of their strokes.

- Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol.\
  **"Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail."**\
  _Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to   regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail._
- John Keats wote 14 lines of F's

    Deep in the shady sadness of a vale\
    Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\
    Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\
    Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\
    Still as the silence round about his lair;\
    Forest on forest hung about his head\
    Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\
    Not so much life as on a summer’s day\
    Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,\
    But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\
    A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\
    By reason of his fallen divinity\
    Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds\
    Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.
